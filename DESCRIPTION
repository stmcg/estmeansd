Description: Implements the methods of McGrath et al. (2020) 
    <doi:10.1177/0962280219889080> and Cai et al. (2021) 
    <doi:10.1177/09622802211047348> for estimating the sample mean and standard 
    deviation from commonly reported quantiles in meta-analysis. These methods 
    can be applied to studies that report the sample median, sample size, and 
    one or both of (i) the sample minimum and maximum values and (ii) the first 
    and third quartiles. The corresponding standard error estimators described 
    by McGrath et al. (2023) <doi:10.1177/09622802221139233> are also included.
